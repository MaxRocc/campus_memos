**OOP usual notions**
|						|																													|
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|abstraction    		|when a class is abstract, it can't be instantiated 																|
|instantiation  		|creation of an object from a class																					|
|object 				|an instance of a class - the class defines its general characteristics	(variables, methods)						|
|class					|a way of storing both variables and functions (in the case of class functions, they're called methods)				|
|encapsulation  		|using public/private/or protected, you can hide data from outside scrutiny 										|
|inheritance   			|make classes reusable by using the key-word "extends"																|
|polymorphism  		 	|in a programming language that exhibits polymorphism, objects of classes belonging to the same hierarchical tree (inherited from a common base class) may possess functions bearing the same name, but each having different behaviors (ie : a function Move called in a Horse class would be trot, in a Fish class, swim)|
|packaging				|a way of organizing classes in larger systems to make them more organized and manageable (cf. package cohesion & package coupling)|
|import     		    |make classes and/or interfaces available in a different package from the one in which they are defined|
|build					|convert code into a stand-alone form that can be run on a computer or to the form itself|
|final		 		    |final class may not be extended by another class|
|extends/parent/child	|allows a class (the child class) to inherit (access and use) the data and methods stored in its parent class|
|override				|rewriting a method or a variable from a parent class from a child class in order to change its value/action|
|constructor			|a special method of a class that initializes an object of that type										|
|interface				|specifies a group and/or a set of methods, which have not been implemented. When a class implements an interface, the class provides an implementation to all defined interface methods. A single class may implement any number of interfaces. Sometimes, constant declarations are included in an interface, along with method definitions.													|
|getter					|a function that is designed to make data available elsewhere than where it is stored				|
|setter					|a function that will change the value of attibutes											|
|static 				|a static method is the method of a class that can be called without instantiating the object of the class					|
